# Robotics Algorithms
A bunch of cool robotics algorithms
## Implemented Algorithms
- Motion Planning
  - A*
  - RRT* (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree Star)
  - PRM
- Controls
  - PID (Proportional Integral Derivative)
  - LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)
- Localization
  - EKF (Extended Kalman Filter)
  - Particle Filter (Monte Carlo Localization)
- Perception
  - ICP (Iterative Closest Point)
    - Improvements to make: Use Point-to-plane & iterative least squares
